# Deep Iterative Method for High-Dimensional FBSDEs

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the **Deep Iterative Method**, a numerical framework for solving high-dimensional Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). This code accompanies my Master's thesis **"A Deep Iterative Method for High-Dimensional Coupled and McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs"** (University of Toronto, 2025).

FBSDEs provide the mathematical foundation for a wide range of problems in quantitative finance, stochastic control, and engineering. They arise naturally in determining optimal strategies in dynamic, uncertain environments—such as derivative pricing, portfolio optimization, and optimal control of stochastic systems.

## Overview

This package solves general FBSDE systems of the form:

$$
\begin{cases}
dX_t = \mu(t, X_t, Y_t, Z_t) dt + \sigma(t, X_t, Y_t, Z_t) dW_t, & X_0 = x_0 \\
-dY_t = f(t, X_t, Y_t, Z_t) dt - Z_t dW_t, & Y_T = g(X_T)
\end{cases}
$$

where $X_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the forward process, $Y_t \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the backward process, and $Z_t \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ is the control process.

The solver overcomes the curse of dimensionality by approximating the solution maps $(t, x) \mapsto Y_t$ and $(t, x) \mapsto Z_t$ using deep neural networks. The architecture relies on a **Deep Picard Iteration**, effectively treating the solution as the fixed point of a contraction mapping on the space of stochastic processes.

## Key Capabilities

*   **Hierarchical Solver Support:**
    *   **Uncoupled:** Standard systems where forward dynamics are independent of $(Y, Z)$.
    *   **Coupled:** Systems where $X_t$ depends on $Y_t$ and $Z_t$, resolved via a Global Picard Iteration.
    *   **McKean-Vlasov:** Mean-field systems where coefficients depend on the law $\mathcal{L}(X_t, Y_t, Z_t)$.
*   **Rigorous Benchmarking:** Includes five standard test equations with analytical solutions for the different problem classes. 
*   **Two Z-Approximation Schemes:** Supports both **Gradient-based** and **Regression-based** approximation for the control process.
*   **GPU Accelerated:** Fully vectorized PyTorch implementation supporting CUDA execution for high-dimensional problems.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Equations

You can define custom FBSDE systems by subclassing the `FBSDE` base class and implementing the required methods. Once defined, your custom equation can be used with any of the solvers in the library.

```python
from dim_fbsde.equations.base import FBSDE
import torch

class MyCustomEquation(FBSDE):
    def __init__(self, dim_x, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(dim_x=dim_x, dim_y=1, dim_w=dim_x,
                         x0=torch.ones(dim_x), **kwargs)

    def drift(self, t, x, y, z, **kwargs):
        # Define your forward drift
        return torch.zeros_like(x)

    def diffusion(self, t, x, y, z, **kwargs):
        # Define your forward diffusion
        return torch.diag_embed(x)

    def driver(self, t, x, y, z, **kwargs):
        # Define your backward driver
        return -y

    def terminal_condition(self, x, **kwargs):
        # Define terminal condition
        return torch.sum(x**2, dim=1, keepdim=True)
```

## Algorithm Details

### Deep Picard Iteration (Uncoupled Solver)

For uncoupled systems, the solver computes the fixed point of the solution map defined by the integral form of the BSDE. At each iteration k:

1. **Simulation**: Generate forward paths using Euler-Maruyama scheme
2. **Approximation**: Train neural network to minimize L²-error:

```math
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[ \left| \mathcal{N}_Y(t_i, X_{t_i}) - \left( g(X_T) + \int_{t_i}^T f(s, X_s, Y_s^{(k-1)}, Z_s^{(k-1)}) ds \right) \right|^2 \right]
```

### Global Iteration (Coupled & Mean-Field)

For **Coupled** and **McKean-Vlasov** systems, a global fixed-point iteration resolves circular dependencies:

1. **Forward Step**: Simulate state process using fixed coefficients from previous estimates Y<sup>(k-1)</sup>, Z<sup>(k-1)</sup> (and empirical law for mean-field)
2. **Backward Step**: Solve the resulting uncoupled BSDE using Deep Picard Iteration to update Y<sup>(k)</sup>, Z<sup>(k)</sup>

### Z Estimation Schemes

The control process Z<sub>t</sub> is approximated using one of two methods:

1. **Gradient-Based** (`z_method='gradient'`): Computes Z<sub>t</sub> via automatic differentiation using the Feynman-Kac representation:
```math
Z_t = \nabla_x \mathcal{N}_Y(t, X_t) \cdot \sigma(t, X_t, Y_t, Z_t)
```

<br>

2. **Regression-Based** (`z_method='regression'`): Trains a secondary network to approximate the martingale representation term:
```math
Z_t \approx \frac{1}{\Delta t} \mathbb{E}\left[ (Y_{t+\Delta t} - Y_t) \Delta W_t^\top \mid \mathcal{F}_t \right]
```
